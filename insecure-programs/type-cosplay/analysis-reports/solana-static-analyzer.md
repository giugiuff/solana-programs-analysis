# High Issues

## H-1: Missing Signer Check in 'InsecureTypeCosplay'

Detects Anchor account fields that may need signer verification

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in src/lib.rs [Line: 26]

	```rust
	#[derive(Accounts)]
	pub struct InsecureTypeCosplay<'info> {
	    /// CHECK: unsafe, does not check the Account type
	    pub user: AccountInfo<'info>,
	    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
	}
	```


<details><summary>Recommendations</summary>

1. Add signer constraint to account fields that should be signed: #[account(signer)]
2. Use Signer<'info> type for accounts that must be signers of the transaction
3. Verify account ownership and signer status in instruction logic when needed
4. Consider using #[account(constraint = account.key() == signer.key())] for explicit signer validation
5. Review all account fields to ensure proper authorization and access control

# Low Issues

## L-1: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'insecure_user_read'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in src/lib.rs [Line: 9]

	```rust
	pub fn insecure_user_read(ctx: Context<InsecureTypeCosplay>) -> Result<()> {
	        let user = User::try_from_slice(&ctx.accounts.user.data.borrow())?;
	
	        if user.authority != ctx.accounts.authority.key() {
	            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData.into());
	        }
	
	        msg!(
	            "The Age of the User: {} is: {}",
	            ctx.accounts.authority.key(),
	            user.age
	        );
	        Ok(())
	    }
	```


<details><summary>Recommendations</summary>

1. Ensure all instruction handlers return Result<()> for proper error handling
2. Add proper account validation using constraints in your Context struct
3. Consider adding access control checks at the beginning of instruction handlers
4. Use #[access_control] attribute for complex authorization logic
5. Document instruction parameters and expected account states

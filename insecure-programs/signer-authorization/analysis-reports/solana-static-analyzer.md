# Low Issues

## L-1: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'initialize'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in src/lib.rs [Line: 9]

	```rust
	pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>, data: u8) -> Result<()> {
	    let escrow = &mut ctx.accounts.escrow;
	    escrow.authority = *ctx.accounts.authority.key;
	    escrow.data = data;
	
	    Ok(())
	  }
	```


<details><summary>Recommendations</summary>

1. Ensure all instruction handlers return Result<()> for proper error handling
2. Add proper account validation using constraints in your Context struct
3. Consider adding access control checks at the beginning of instruction handlers
4. Use #[access_control] attribute for complex authorization logic
5. Document instruction parameters and expected account states

## L-2: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'insecure_authorization'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in src/lib.rs [Line: 16]

	```rust
	pub fn insecure_authorization(ctx: Context<InsecureAuthorization>, data: u8) -> Result<()> {
	    let escrow = &mut ctx.accounts.escrow;
	    escrow.data = data;
	
	    msg!("Data: {}", escrow.data);
	
	    Ok(())
	  }

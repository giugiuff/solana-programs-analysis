## L-1: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'secure_user_read'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in src/lib.rs [Line: 9]

	```rust
	pub fn secure_user_read(ctx: Context<SecureTypeCosplay>) -> Result<()> {
	        let user = &ctx.accounts.user;
	        msg!(
	            "The Age of the User: {} is: {}",
	            ctx.accounts.authority.key(),
	            user.age
	        );
	        Ok(())
	    }
	```


<details><summary>Recommendations</summary>

1. Ensure all instruction handlers return Result<()> for proper error handling
2. Add proper account validation using constraints in your Context struct
3. Consider adding access control checks at the beginning of instruction handlers
4. Use #[access_control] attribute for complex authorization logic
5. Document instruction parameters and expected account states

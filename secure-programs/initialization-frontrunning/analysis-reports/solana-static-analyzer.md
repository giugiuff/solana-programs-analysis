## M-1: Owner Check Validation in 'InitializeSecure'

Detects structs that properly implement owner checks for account validation

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in src/lib.rs [Line: 19]

	```rust
	#[derive(Accounts)]
	pub struct InitializeSecure<'info> {
	    #[account(
	        mut,
	        constraint = signer.key() == program_data.upgrade_authority_address.unwrap_or_default()
	    )]
	    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
	    #[account(
	        init,
	        payer = signer,
	        space = 8 + GlobalConfig::INIT_SPACE,
	        seeds = [b"config"],
	        bump
	    )]
	    pub global_config: Account<'info, GlobalConfig>,
	    #[account(
	        seeds = [crate::ID.as_ref()],
	        bump,
	        seeds::program = bpf_loader_upgradeable::id(),
	    )]
	    pub program_data: Account<'info, ProgramData>,
	    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
	}
	```


<details><summary>Recommendations</summary>

1. Add explicit owner validation in your account struct using #[account(constraint = account.owner == expected_owner)] or similar patterns
2. Use Anchor's built-in Account<'info, T> wrapper which automatically validates the account owner
3. Implement manual owner checks in your instruction handler before processing the account
4. Consider using Anchor's #[account(owner = program_id)] constraint for program-owned accounts

## L-1: Anchor Instructions Detection in 'initialize_secure'

Detects functions that are Anchor program instructions (public functions with Context parameter)

<details><summary>1 Found Instance</summary>

- Found in src/lib.rs [Line: 10]

	```rust
	pub fn initialize_secure(ctx: Context<InitializeSecure>, additional_data: u8) -> Result<()> {
	        let global_config = &mut ctx.accounts.global_config;
	
	        global_config.authority = ctx.accounts.signer.key();
	        global_config.additional_data = additional_data;
	        Ok(())
	    }
	```


<details><summary>Recommendations</summary>

1. Ensure all instruction handlers return Result<()> for proper error handling
2. Add proper account validation using constraints in your Context struct
3. Consider adding access control checks at the beginning of instruction handlers
4. Use #[access_control] attribute for complex authorization logic
5. Document instruction parameters and expected account states
